# RETROSPECTIVE #2 (Team 05)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

<!-- - Number of stories committed vs. done
- Total points committed vs. done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) -->
  | Description | Committed | Done |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | Number of stories | 6 | 6 |
  | Total points | 8 | 8 |
  | Nr of hours | 90.25  |  86.58 |

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

<!-- > Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) -->


### Detailed statistics

| Story                  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #0                     | 23      |   -    |    37h15m  |    37h45m    |
| Accept application     |  3      |   2    |    4       |   4          |
| Browse application decisions |2  | 1      | 9          |   4h40m      |   
| Browse proposals |  1    |   1   |   1   |   1h20m    |
| Update proposal  |  3    |   2  |    12   |   14     |
| Delete proposal  |  3  |  1 |  7  |  7h15m  |
| Archive proposal |  3  | 1 |  10  |  8   |

<!-- > place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case) -->

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  | Description | Estimated | Actual |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | Hours per task average |2.38 | 2.28 |
  |Standard Deviation (h) | 1.59 | 1.57 |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = 0.04

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7.5
  - Total hours spent: 7.5 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 54
  - Coverage (if available): 66.4 %
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5
  - Total hours spent: 5
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 5
  - Total hours spent: 4.25

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
>Perhaps for this sprint we overestimated and didn't commit to enough stories. Seen that the previous one we worked more hours, we tried to have a more conservative approach to the number of hours, bumping up the number by a bit. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
> We increased the number of SCRUM meetings, which resulted in better organization and discussion about each other works between us. We used a method of development that created bottlenecks, instead we should parallelize how each person works.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
> Defining everything before the start, at the sprint planning we took our time to discuss what was needed for the stories.
> Doing more merges and fixing conflicts saved us time in the end of sprint, but still there should be more cooperation.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
> Still needs to improve communication. If we find bugs in the code open a GitHub issue and say to the others what we are going to work on.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
> 1. Be up to date with the FAQ and telegram messages that could affect how we are working.
> 2. Keep Readme file constantly updated with our code changes, so all of us can know the implementations faster.
> 3. We should be more proactive towards helping the other.


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
>At the end, we deliver a good product.

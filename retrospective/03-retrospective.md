RETROSPECTIVE 03 (Team 05)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done 
- Total points committed vs done 
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)

  | Description       | Committed | Done |
  | ----------------- | --------- | ---- |
  | Number of stories | 8         | 5    |
  | Total points      | 15        | 9    |
  | Nr of hours       | 96        | 96   |

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  | 14      | -      | 50         |              |
| n9    | 2       | 2      | 5          | 3h45m        |
| n11   | 1       | 1      | 3h30m      | 4h30m        |
| n13   | 4       | 2      | 11h        | 10h15m       |
| n14   | 2       | 2      | 5h15m      | 6h           |
| n15   | 1       | 2      | 5h15m      | 5h15m        |
| n16   | 1       | 1      | 20m        | 15m          |
| n18   | 1       | 2      | 45m        | 1h           |
| n26   | 3       | 3      | 11h        | 10h40m       |
   

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): 

| Description | Estimated | Actual |
  | ----- | ------- | ------ |
  | Hours per task average |3,2 | 3,13 |
  |Standard Deviation (h) | 1,88 | 2,03 |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1 = 0,02

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5.75
  - Total hours spent: 5.42
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 74
  - Coverage (if available): 78.1%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5.5
  - Total hours spent: 3.5
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 6.5
  - Total hours spent: 6.5
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 5
  - Total hours spent: 5h11m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 25h
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues: 5h 
  - Hours spent on remediation: 5h11m
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.7%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ): A A A
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
